## 💎  Tokenomics: Utility and Incentives

The economic model of the **$VC** token is designed to align the interests of users, developers, and the platform's long-term success.

### Token Utility (Access)

The primary utility of the **$VC** token is to grant access to platform features:

* **Premium Feature Unlock:** Holding a specified minimum balance of **$VC** in a linked wallet will automatically unlock access to premium-locked services

### Token Incentives (Reward)

We believe in rewarding those who build the platform. **$VC** is the exclusive reward mechanism for community contributions:

* **Contributor Rewards:** Developers, technical writers, security researchers, and community managers who contribute high-quality, merged code or documentation will be rewarded with an allocation of **$VC** tokens.
